I am lucky to have some great people in my circle of friends and acquaintances who are successful both in their personal and professional life.  Some of them even take pride in their works since they do them (their works) really well, and I am going to share the story of one such person, whom I have known for a long time.

This person is none other than the father of one of my high school friends who I have known for more than 10 years.  The person, I am talking about, is a “Tailor” or a “Dressmaker” by profession.  He runs his tailor shop at a very prime location of our hometown, and as far as I remember, I have never seen a dull moment at his shop because people from all over the town visit his shop to get their dresses made just the way they prefer.

Initially, I thought that most people visit his shop to make their dresses because he would charge them less money for making them, but I was later proved out to be wrong when I found out that they visit him also because he is really good at his works.  Of course, one of the great characteristics of this person is that he personally gets involved with every detail of the works of his employees and subordinates so that there is no room for errors.  Besides, I have seldom seen him missing his work except when he is really sick. In fact, I have found him to be working even on public holidays sometimes.

Anyway, I think that this person is really good at doing what he does, mainly because I have never heard any complaints from any of his customers about his quality of works.  Besides, the fact that so many people from in and outside of our city visit him on a daily basis to get all kinds of dresses done, be them for male, female, children or professional, goes to prove the fact that he is really good at his tailoring job</p>
